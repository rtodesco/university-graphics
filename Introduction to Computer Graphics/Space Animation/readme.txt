Assignment 2

- Multiple hierarchical objects including Earth and Moon, Saturn and it's rings, and rocket ship

- All planets and Sun are textured

- Shader that allows objects to be one of three different types:
	1. Textured
		- Regular texture shader
	2. Normal colour
		- Regular colour shader
	3. Flashing
		- Shader increases or decreases the alpha value, making it look like flashing stars
- Note: I was not able to figure out how to switch between different programs for the shaders so I just put them all in one and used an if statement

- Camera moves in a 360 degree spin

- Framerate is displayed in the console log
